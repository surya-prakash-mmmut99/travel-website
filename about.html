        travelling teaches you about the world
      </h3>

       <p>“The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” – said Saint Augustine. Travelling can teach you more than any university course. You learn about the culture of the country you visit. If you talk to locals, you will likely learn about their thinking, habits, traditions and history as well</p>


       <h3>
        Travelling  teaches you about yourself
      </h3>
      <video src="icon/vid-4.mp4" id="video-slider" lood autoplay muted></video>
       <p>You can learn a lot about yourself through travelling. You can observe how you feel beeing far from your country. You will find out how you feel about your homeland. You will realise how you really feel about foreign people. You will find out how much you know/do not know about the world. You will be able to observe how you react in completely new situations. You will test your language, orientational and social skills. You will not be the same person after returning home.</p>


       <h3>
        Travelling provides you with unforgettable moments and experiences
      </h3>
      <video src="icon/vid-2.mp4" id="video-slider" lood autoplay muted></video>
       <p>Some of my most cherished memories are from the times when I was travelling. If you travel, you can experience things that you could never experience at home. You may see beautiful places and landscapes that do not exist where you live. You may meet people that will change your life, and your thingking. You may try activities that you have never tried before. </p>
